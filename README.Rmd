# Quantitative Methods 3: Data Mining and Statistical Learning

**Department of Political Science, Trinity College Dublin, HT 2017**

[Kenneth Benoit](kbenoit@tcd.ie)

This repository contains the class materials for Quantitative Methods 3: Data Mining and Statistical Learning taught in Hillary Term 2017 by Kenneth Benoit.  

The class meets Mondays for five sessions, every other Monday, starting 23 January 2017.  Times: 12:00 - 15:00.

## Overview

Data Mining and Statistical Learning are exciting new areas that combine scientific inquiry, statistical knowledge, substantive expertise, and computer programming.  Good data science requires experts that combine substantive knowledge with data analytical skills, which makes it a prime area for social scientists with an interest in quantitative methods. This course integrates prior training in quantitative methods (statistics) and coding with substantive expertise and introduces the fundamental concepts and techniques of data mining and statistical learning.  Examples focus on political science and methods are tailored to areas that are useful for political science research.


## Objectives

This course aims to provide an introduction to the data science approach to the quantitative analysis of data using the methods of statistical learning, an approach blending classical statistical methods with recent advances in computational and machine learning. We will cover the main analytical methods from this field with hands-on applications using example datasets, so that students gain experience with and confidence in using the methods we cover. We also cover data preparation and processing, including working with structured databases, key-value formatted data (JSON), and unstructured textual data. At the end of this course students will have a sound understanding of the field of data science, the ability to analyse data using some of its main methods, and a solid foundation for more advanced or more specialised study.  
The course will be delivered through a combination of lectures and guided learning through detailed weekly assignments to be completed outside of class.  


## Important Specifics

### Computer Software

Computer-based exercises will feature prominently in the course, especially in the lab sessions.  The use of all software tools will be explained in the sessions, including how to download and install them.  All of the class work will be done using R, using publicly available packages.

### Main Texts

The primary texts are:

* James et al. (2013) _An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With applications in R_, Springer. Note: The book is available from the authors' page [here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).
* Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham (2016) _R for Data Science_, O'Reilly Media. Note: Online version is available from the authors' page [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html).
* Zumel, N. and Mount, J. (2014). _Practical Data Science with R_. Manning Publications.


The following are supplemental texts which you may also find useful:

* Lantz, B. (2013). _Machine Learning with R_. Packt Publishing.
* Lesmeister, C. (2015). _Mastering Machine Learning with R_. Packt Publishing.
* Conway, D. and White, J. (2012) _Machine Learning for Hackers_. O'Reilly Media.
* Leskovec, J., Rajaraman, A. and Ullman, J. (2011). _Mining of Massive Datasets_. Cambridge University Press.
* Zafarani, R., Abbasi, M. A. and Liu, H. (2014) _Social Media Mining: An introduction_. Cambridge University Press.
* Hastie et al. (2009) _The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data mining, inference, and prediction_. Springer. Note: The book is available from the authors' page [here](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/).
* Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham (2016) _R for Data Science_, O'Reilly Media, Chapters 1-3. Note: Online version is available from the authors' page [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html).


### Instructions for Submitting Homeworks

Each homework will be a single file in the [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) format.  The files linked below are *named very carefully*, to make it easy for us to identify your completed lab assignments.  

1.  Obtaining the starter files.  

    Each day below will link the name of a starter file for you to download and work with.  These are in the RMarkdown format.  You should embed your answers, with code, into your version of the instruction files.

    To help learn this, I suggest you look at the following resources:

    *  Downloading and installing [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com) and [R](https://cran.r-project.org) on your computer.
    *  Data Camp [R Markdown tutorials](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/reporting-with-r-markdown), first chapter.


2.  Renaming the starter files.  

    For example, the first assignment file is named `quant3_assignment1_LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME.Rmd`, which you will need to rename by replacing the uppercase terms with your own last and first names, e.g. `quant3_assignment1_Bloggs_Joe.Rmd`.

3.  From RStudio, you can create an HTML output file with your evaluated code, figure, and text answers by clicking the "Knit HTML" button in the top of the editor pane in RStudio.  The resulting HTML file will be saved in your working directory.

4.  You will need to email the completed file to me at kbenoit@tcd.ie.

Don't worry if it seems complicated the first time.  This sort of careful workflow process and file management is part of learning practical data science too.


### Instructions for use of course materials

You have three options for downloading the course material found on this page:  

1.  You can download the materials by clicking on each link.  

2.  You can "clone" repository, using the buttons found to the right side of your browser window as you view this repository.  This is the button labelled "Clone in Desktop".  If you do not have a git client installed on your system, you will need to [get one here](https://git-scm.com/download/gui) and also to make sure that [git is installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  This is preferred, since you can refresh your clone as new content gets pushed to the course repository.  (And new material will get actively pushed to the course repository at least once per day as this course takes place.)

3.  Statically, you can choose the button on the right marked "Download zip" which will download the entire repository as a zip file.

You can also subscribe to the repository if you have [a GitHub account](https://github.com), which will send you updates each time new changes are pushed to the repository.
